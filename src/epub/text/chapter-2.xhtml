			<p class="drop-cap">THE Marchesa was something which happened at irregular but inevitable moments in Mrs. Manford’s life.</p>
			<p>Most people would have regarded the Marchesa as a disturbance; some as a distinct inconvenience; the pessimistic as a misfortune. It was a matter of conscious pride to Mrs. Manford that, while recognizing these elements in the case, she had always contrived to make out of it something not only showy but even enviable.</p>
			<p>For, after all, if your husband (even an ex-husband) has a first cousin called Amalasuntha degli Duchi di Lucera, who has married the Marchese Venturino di San Fedele, of one of the great Neapolitan families, it seems stupid and wasteful not to make some use of such a conjunction of names and situations, and to remember only (as the Wyants did) that when Amalasuntha came to New York it was always to get money, or to get her dreadful son out of a new scrape, or to consult the family lawyers as to some new way of guarding the remains of her fortune against Venturino’s systematic depredations.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Manford knew in advance the hopelessness of these quests⁠—all of them, that is, except that which consisted in borrowing money from herself. She always lent Amalasuntha two or three thousand dollars (and put it down to the profit-and-loss column of her carefully-kept private accounts); she even gave the Marchesa her own last year’s clothes, cleverly retouched; and in return she expected Amalasuntha to shed on the Manford entertainments that exotic lustre which the near relative of a Duke who is also a grandee of Spain and a great dignitary of the Papal Court trails with her through the dustiest by-ways, even if her mother has been a mere Mary Wyant of Albany.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Manford had been successful. The Marchesa, without taking thought, fell naturally into the part assigned to her. In her stormy and uncertain life, New York, where her rich relations lived, and from which she always came back with a few thousand dollars, and clothes that could be made to last a year, and good advice about putting the screws on Venturino, was like a foretaste of heaven. “Live there? Carina, <i>no</i>! It is too⁠—too uneventful. As heaven must be. But everybody is celestially kind⁠ ⁠… and Venturino has learnt that there are certain things my American relations will not tolerate⁠ ⁠…” Such was Amalasuntha’s version of her visits to New York, when she recounted them in the drawing-rooms of Rome, Naples or St. Moritz; whereas in New York, quite carelessly and unthinkingly⁠—for no one was simpler at heart than Amalasuntha⁠—she pronounced names, and raised suggestions, which cast a romantic glow of unreality over a world bounded by Wall Street on the south and Long Island in most other directions; and in this glow Pauline Manford was always eager to sun her other guests.</p>
			<p>“My husband’s cousin” (become, since the divorce from Wyant “my son’s cousin”) was still, after twenty-seven years, a useful social card. The Marchesa di San Fedele, now a woman of fifty, was still, in Pauline’s set, a pretext for dinners, a means of paying off social scores, a small but steady luminary in the uncertain New York heavens. Pauline could never see her rather forlorn wisp of a figure, always clothed in careless unnoticeable black (even when she wore Mrs. Manford’s old dresses), without a vision of echoing Roman staircases, of the torchlit arrival of Cardinals at the Lucera receptions, of a great fresco-like background of Popes, princes, dilapidated palaces, cypress-guarded villas, scandals, tragedies, and interminable feuds about inheritances.</p>
			<p>“It’s all so dreadful⁠—the wicked lives those great Roman families lead. After all, poor Amalasuntha has good American blood in her⁠—her mother was a Wyant; yes⁠—Mary Wyant married Prince Ottaviano di Lago Negro, the Duke of Lucera’s son, who used to be at the Italian Legation in Washington; but what is Amalasuntha to do, in a country where there’s no divorce, and a woman just has to put up with <i>everything</i>? The Pope has been most kind; he sides entirely with Amalasuntha. But Venturino’s people are very powerful too⁠—a great Neapolitan family⁠—yes, Cardinal Ravello is Venturino’s uncle⁠ ⁠… so that altogether it’s been dreadful for Amalasuntha⁠ ⁠… and such an oasis to her, coming back to her own people⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Pauline Manford was quite sincere in believing that it was dreadful for Amalasuntha. Pauline herself could conceive of nothing more shocking than a social organization which did not recognize divorce, and let all kinds of domestic evils fester undisturbed, instead of having people’s lives disinfected and whitewashed at regular intervals, like the cellar. But while Mrs. Manford thought all this⁠—in fact, in the very act of thinking it⁠—she remembered that Cardinal Ravello, Venturino’s uncle, had been mentioned as one of the probable delegates to the Roman Catholic Congress which was to meet at Baltimore that winter, and wondered whether an evening party for his Eminence could not be organized with Amalasuntha’s help; even got as far as considering the effect of torch-bearing footmen (in silk stockings) lining the Manford staircase⁠—which was of marble, thank goodness!⁠—and of Dexter Manford and Jim receiving the Prince of the Church on the doorstep, and walking upstairs backward carrying silver candelabra; though Pauline wasn’t sure she could persuade them to go as far as that.</p>
			<p>Pauline felt no more inconsistency in this double train of thought than she did in shuddering at the crimes of the Roman Church and longing to receive one of its dignitaries with all the proper ceremonial. She was used to such rapid adjustments, and proud of the fact that whole categories of contradictory opinions lay down together in her mind as peacefully as the Happy Families exhibited by strolling circuses. And of course, if the Cardinal <i>did</i> come to her house, she would show her American independence by inviting also the Bishop of New York⁠—her own Episcopal Bishop⁠—and possibly the Chief Rabbi (also a friend of hers), and certainly that wonderful much-slandered “Mahatma” in whom she still so thoroughly believed⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>But the word pulled her up short. Yes; certainly she believed in the “Mahatma.” She had every reason to. Standing before the tall threefold mirror in her dressing-room, she glanced into the huge bathroom beyond⁠—which looked like a biological laboratory, with its white tiles, polished pipes, weighing machines, mysterious appliances for douches, gymnastics and “physical culture”⁠—and recalled with gratitude that it was certainly those eurythmic exercises of the Mahatma’s (“holy ecstasy,” he called them) which had reduced her hips after everything else had failed. And this gratitude for the reduction of her hips was exactly on the same plane, in her neat card-catalogued mind, with her enthusiastic faith in his wonderful mystical teachings about Self-Annihilation, Anterior Existence and Astral Affinities⁠ ⁠… all so incomprehensible and so pure⁠ ⁠… Yes; she would certainly ask the Mahatma. It would do the Cardinal good to have a talk with him. She could almost hear his Eminence saying, in a voice shaken by emotion: “Mrs. Manford, I want to thank you for making me know that Wonderful Man. If it hadn’t been for you⁠—”</p>
			<p>Ah, she did like people who said to her: “If it hadn’t been for you⁠—!”</p>
			<p>The telephone on her dressing-table rang. Miss Bruss had switched on from the boudoir. Mrs. Manford, as she unhooked the receiver, cast a nervous glance at the clock. She was already seven minutes late for her Marcel-waving, and⁠—</p>
			<p>Ah: it was Dexter’s voice! Automatically she composed her face to a wifely smile, and her voice to a corresponding intonation. “Yes? Pauline, dear. Oh⁠—about dinner tonight? Why, you know, Amalasuntha⁠ ⁠… You say you’re going to the theatre with Jim and Lita? But, Dexter, you can’t! They’re dining here⁠—Jim and Lita are. But <i>of course</i>⁠ ⁠… Yes, it must have been a mistake; Lita’s so flighty⁠ ⁠… I know⁠ ⁠…” (The smile grew a little pinched; the voice echoed it. Then, patiently): “Yes; what else?⁠ ⁠… <i>Oh</i>⁠ ⁠… oh, Dexter⁠ ⁠… what do you mean?⁠ ⁠… The Mahatma? <i>What</i>? I don’t understand!”</p>
			<p>But she did. She was conscious of turning white under her discreet cosmetics. Somewhere in the depths of her there had lurked for the last weeks an unexpressed fear of this very thing: a fear that the people who were opposed to the teaching of the Hindu sage⁠—New York’s great “spiritual uplift” of the last two years⁠—were gaining power and beginning to be a menace. And here was Dexter Manford actually saying something about having been asked to conduct an investigation into the state of things at the Mahatma’s “School of Oriental Thought,” in which all sorts of unpleasantness might be involved. Of course Dexter never said much about professional matters on the telephone; he did not, to his wife’s thinking, say enough about them when he got home. But what little she now gathered made her feel positively ill.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Dexter, but I must see you about this! At once! You couldn’t come back to lunch, I suppose? Not possibly? No⁠—this evening there’ll be no chance. Why, the dinner for Amalasuntha⁠—oh, please don’t forget it <i>again</i>!”</p>
			<p>With one hand on the receiver, she reached with the other for her engagement-list (the duplicate of Miss Bruss’s), and ran a nervous unseeing eye over it. A scandal⁠—another scandal! It mustn’t be. She loathed scandals. And besides, she did believe in the Mahatma. He had “vision.” From the moment when she had picked up that word in a magazine article she had felt she had a complete answer about him⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>“But I must see you before this evening, Dexter. Wait! I’m looking over my engagements.” She came to “4 P.m. See A. 4.30 Musical⁠—Torfried Lobb.” No; she couldn’t give up Torfried Lobb: she was one of the fifty or sixty ladies who had “discovered” him the previous winter, and she knew he counted on her presence at his recital. Well, then⁠—for once “A” must be sacrificed.</p>
			<p>“Listen, Dexter; if I were to come to the office at 4? Yes; sharp. Is that right? And don’t do anything till I see you⁠—promise!”</p>
			<p>She hung up with a sigh of relief. She would try to readjust things so as to see “A” the next day; though readjusting her list in the height of the season was as exhausting as a major operation.</p>
			<p>In her momentary irritation she was almost inclined to feel as if it were Arthur’s fault for figuring on that day’s list, and thus unsettling all her arrangements. Poor Arthur⁠—from the first he had been one of her failures. She had a little cemetery of them⁠—a very small one⁠—planted over with quick-growing things, so that you might have walked all through her life and not noticed there were any graves in it. To the inexperienced Pauline of thirty years ago, fresh from the factory-smoke of Exploit, Arthur Wyant had symbolized the tempting contrast between a city absorbed in making money and a society bent on enjoying it. Such a brilliant figure⁠—and nothing to show for it! She didn’t know exactly what she had expected, her own ideal of manly achievement being at that time solely based on the power of getting rich faster than your neighbours⁠—which Arthur would certainly never do. His father-in-law at Exploit had seen at a glance that it was no use taking him into the motor-business, and had remarked philosophically to Pauline: “Better just regard him as a piece of jewellery: I guess we can afford it.”</p>
			<p>But jewellery must at least be brilliant; and Arthur had somehow⁠—faded. At one time she had hoped he might play a part in state politics⁠—with Washington and its enticing diplomatic society at the end of the vista⁠—but he shrugged that away as contemptuously as what he called “trade.” At Cedarledge he farmed a little, fussed over the accounts, and muddled away her money till she replaced him by a trained superintendent; and in town he spent hours playing bridge at his club, took an intermittent interest in racing, and went and sat every afternoon with his mother, old Mrs. Wyant, in the dreary house near Stuyvesant Square which had never been “done over,” and was still lit by Carcel lamps.</p>
			<p>An obstacle and a disappointment; that was what he had always been. Still, she would have borne with his inadequacy, his resultless planning, dreaming and dawdling, even his growing tendency to drink, as the wives of her generation were taught to bear with such failings, had it not been for the discovery that he was also “immoral.” Immorality no high-minded woman could condone; and when, on her return from a rest-cure in California, she found that he had drifted into a furtive love affair with the dependent cousin who lived with his mother, every law of self-respect known to Pauline decreed his repudiation. Old Mrs. Wyant, horror-struck, banished the cousin and pleaded for her son: Pauline was adamant. She addressed herself to the rising divorce-lawyer, Dexter Manford, and in his capable hands the affair was settled rapidly, discreetly, without scandal, wrangling or recrimination. Wyant withdrew to his mother’s house, and Pauline went to Europe, a free woman.</p>
			<p>In the early days of the new century divorce had not become a social institution in New York, and the blow to Wyant’s pride was deeper than Pauline had foreseen. He lived in complete retirement at his mother’s, saw his boy at the dates prescribed by the court, and sank into a sort of premature old age which contrasted painfully⁠—even to Pauline herself⁠—with her own recovered youth and elasticity. The contrast caused her a retrospective pang, and gradually, after her second marriage, and old Mrs. Wyant’s death, she came to regard poor Arthur not as a grievance but as a responsibility. She prided herself on never neglecting her responsibilities, and therefore felt a not unnatural vexation with Arthur for having figured among her engagements that day, and thus obliged her to postpone him.</p>
			<p>Moving back to the dressing-table she caught her reflection in the tall triple glass. Again those fine wrinkles about lids and lips, those vertical lines between the eyes! She would not permit it; no, not for a moment. She commanded herself: “Now, Pauline, <i>stop worrying</i>. You know perfectly well there’s no such thing as worry; it’s only dyspepsia or want of exercise, and everything’s really all right⁠—” in the insincere tone of a mother soothing a bruised baby.</p>
			<p>She looked again, and fancied the wrinkles were really fainter, the vertical lines less deep. Once more she saw before her an erect athletic woman, with all her hair and all her teeth, and just a hint of rouge (because “people did it”) brightening a still fresh complexion; saw her small symmetrical features, the black brows drawn with a light stroke over handsome directly-gazing gray eyes, the abundant whitening hair which still responded so crisply to the waver’s wand, the firmly planted feet with arched insteps rising to slim ankles.</p>
			<p>How absurd, how unlike herself, to be upset by that foolish news! She would look in on Dexter and settle the Mahatma business in five minutes. If there was to be a scandal she wasn’t going to have Dexter mixed up in it⁠—above all not against the Mahatma. She could never forget that it was the Mahatma who had first told her she was psychic.</p>
			<p>The maid opened an inner door an inch or two to say rebukingly: “Madam, the hair-dresser; and Miss Bruss asked me to remind you⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes, yes,” Mrs. Manford responded hastily; repeating below her breath, as she flung herself into her kimono and settled down before her toilet-table: “Now, I forbid you to let yourself feel hurried! You <i>know</i> there’s no such thing as hurry.”</p>
			<p>But her eye again turned anxiously to the little clock among her scent-bottles, and she wondered if she might not save time by dictating to Maisie Bruss while she was being waved and manicured. She envied women who had no sense of responsibility⁠—like Jim’s little Lita. As for herself, the only world she knew rested on her shoulders.</p>

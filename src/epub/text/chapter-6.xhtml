PAULINE MANFORD sent a satisfied glance down the table.
</p>
<p>
It was on such occasions that she visibly reaped her reward. No one else
in New York had so accomplished a cook, such smoothly running service, a
dinner-table so softly yet brightly lit, or such skill in grouping about
it persons not only eminent in wealth or fashion, but likely to find
pleasure in each other's society.
</p>
<p>
The intimate reunion, of the not-more-than-the-Muses kind, was not
Pauline's affair. She was aware of this, and seldom made the
attempt—though, when she did, she was never able to discover why it
was not a success. But in the organizing and administering of a big dinner
she was conscious of mastery. Not the stupid big dinner of old days,
when the "crowned heads" used to be treated like a caste apart, and
everlastingly invited to meet each other through a whole monotonous
season: Pauline was too modern for that. She excelled in a judicious
blending of Wall Street and Bohemia, and her particular art lay in her
selection of the latter element. Of course there were Bohemians and
Bohemians; as she had once remarked to Nona, people weren't always
amusing just because they were clever, or dull just because they were
rich—though at the last clause Nona had screwed up her nose
incredulously... Well, even Nona would be satisfied tonight, Pauline
thought. It wasn't everybody who would have been bold enough to ask a
social reformer like Parker Greg with the very people least disposed to
encourage social reform, nor a young composer like Torfried Lobb (a
disciple of "The Six") with all those stolid opera-goers, nor that
disturbing Tommy Ardwin, the Cubist decorator, with the owners of the
most expensive "period houses" in Fifth Avenue.
</p>
<p>
Pauline was not a bit afraid of such combinations. She knew in advance
that at one of her dinners everything would "go"—it always did. And
her success amused and exhilarated her so much that, even tonight, though
she had come down oppressed with problems, they slipped from her before
she even had time to remind herself that they were nonexistent. She had
only to look at the faces gathered about that subdued radiance of old
silver and scattered flowers to be sure of it. There, at the other end
of the table, was her husband's dark head, comely and resolute in its
vigorous middle-age; on his right the Marchesa di San Fedele, the famous
San Fedele pearls illuminating her inconspicuous black; on his left the
handsome Mrs. Herman Toy, magnanimously placed there by Pauline because
she knew that Manford was said to be "taken" by her, and she wanted him
to be in good-humour that evening. To measure her own competence she had
only to take in this group, already settling down to an evening's
enjoyment, and then let her glance travel on to the others, the young
and handsome women, the well-dressed confident-looking men. Nona, grave
yet eager, was talking to Manford's legal rival, the brilliant Alfred
Cosby, who was known to have said she was the cleverest girl in New
York. Lita, cool and aloof, drooped her head slightly to listen to
Torfried Lobb, the composer; Jim gazed across the table at Lita as if
his adoration made every intervening obstacle transparent; Aggie
Heuston, whose coldness certainly made her look distinguished, though
people complained that she was dull, dispensed occasional monosyllables
to the ponderous Herman Toy; and Stanley Heuston, leaning back with that
faint dry smile which Pauline found irritating because it was so
inscrutable, kept his eyes discreetly but steadily on Nona. Dear good
Stan, always like a brother to Nona! People who knew him well said he
wasn't as sardonic as he looked.
</p>
<p>
It was a world after Pauline's heart—a world such as she believed its
Maker meant it to be. She turned to the Bishop on her right, wondering
if he shared her satisfaction, and encountered a glance of
understanding.
</p>
<p>
"So refreshing to be among old friends... This is one of the few houses
left... Always such a pleasure to meet the dear Marchesa; I hope she has
better reports of her son? Wretched business, I'm afraid. My dear Mrs.
Manford, I wonder if you know how blessed you are in your children? That
wise little Nona, who is going to make some man so happy one of these
days—not Cosby, no? Too much difference in age? And your steady
Jim and his idol ... yes, I know it doesn't become my cloth to speak
indulgently of idolatry. But happy marriages are so rare nowadays: where
else could one find such examples as there are about this table? Your
Jim and his Lita, and my good friend Heuston with that saint of a
wife—" The Bishop paused, as if, even on so privileged an
occasion, he was put to it to prolong the list. "Well, you've given them
the example..." He stopped again, probably remembering that his
hostess's matrimonial bliss was built on the ruins of her first
husband's. But in divorcing she had invoked a cause which even the
Church recognizes; and the Bishop proceeded serenely: "<i>Her children
shall rise up and call her blessed</i>—yes, dear friend, you must
let me say it."
</p>
<p>
The words were balm to Pauline. Every syllable carried conviction: all
was right with her world and the Bishop's! Why did she ever need any
other spiritual guidance than that of her own creed? She felt a twinge
of regret at having so involved herself with the Mahatma. Yet what did
Episcopal Bishops know of "holy ecstasy"? And could any number of Church
services have reduced her hips? After all, there was room for all the
creeds in her easy rosy world. And the thought led her straight to her
other preoccupation: the reception for the Cardinal. She resolved to
secure the Bishop's approval at once. After that, of course the Chief
Rabbi would have to come. And what a lesson in tolerance and good-will
to the discordant world she was trying to reform!
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>
Nona, half-way down the table, viewed its guests from another angle. She
had come back depressed rather than fortified from her flying visit to
her father. There were days when Manford liked to be "surprised" at the
office; when he and his daughter had their little jokes together over
these clandestine visits. But this one had not come off in that spirit.
She had found Manford tired and slightly irritable; Nona, before he had
time to tell her of her mother's visit, caught a lingering whiff of
Pauline's cool hygienic scent, and wondered nervously what could have
happened to make Mrs. Manford break through her tightly packed
engagements, and dash down to her husband's office. It was of course to
that emergency that she had sacrificed poor Exhibit A—little guessing
his relief at the postponement. But what could have obliged her to see
Manford so suddenly, when they were to meet at dinner that evening?
</p>
<p>
The girl had asked no questions: she knew that Manford, true to his
profession, preferred putting them. And her chief object, of course, had
been to get him to help her about Arthur Wyant. That, she perceived, at
first added to his irritation: was he Wyant's keeper, he wanted to know?
But he broke off before the next question: "Why the devil can't his own
son look after him?" She had seen that question on his very lips; but
they shut down on it, and he rose from his chair with a shrug. "Poor
devil—if you think I can be of any use? All right, then—I'll
drop in on him tomorrow." He and Wyant, ever since the divorce, had met
whenever Jim's fate was to be discussed; Wyant felt a sort of humiliated
gratitude for Manford's generosity to his son. "Not the money, you know,
Nona—damn the money! But taking such an interest in him; helping
him to find himself: appreciating him, hang it! He understands Jim a
hundred times better than your mother ever did..." On this basis the two
men came together now and then in a spirit of tolerant understanding...
</p>
<p>
Nona recalled her father's face as it had been when she left him:
worried, fagged, yet with that twinkle of gaiety his eyes always had
when he looked at her. Now, smoothed out, smiling, slightly replete, it
was hard as stone. "Like his own death-mask," the girl thought; "as if
he'd done with everything, once for all.—And the way those two women
bore him! Mummy put Gladys Toy next to him as a reward—for what?" She
smiled at her mother's simplicity in imagining that he was having what
Pauline called a "harmless flirtation" with Mrs. Herman Toy. That lady's
obvious charms were no more to him, Nona suspected, than those of the
florid Bathsheba in the tapestry behind his chair. But Pauline had
evidently had some special reason—over and above her usual diffused
benevolence—for wanting to put Manford in a good humour. "The
Mahatma, probably." Nona knew how her mother hated a fuss: how vulgar and
unchristian she always thought it. And it would certainly be
inconvenient to give up the rest-cure at Dawnside she had planned for
March, when Manford was to go off tarpon-fishing.
</p>
<p>
Nona's glance, in the intervals of talk with her neighbours, travelled
farther, lit on Jim's good-humoured wistful face—Jim was always
wistful at his mother's banquets—and flitted on to Aggie Heuston's
precise little mask, where everything was narrow and perpendicular, like
the head of a saint squeezed into a cathedral niche. But the girl's eyes
did not linger, for as they rested on Aggie they abruptly met the
latter's gaze. Aggie had been furtively scrutinizing her, and the
discovery gave Nona a faint shock. In another instant Mrs. Heuston
turned to Parker Greg, the interesting young social reformer whom
Pauline had thoughtfully placed next to her, with the optimistic idea
that all persons interested in improving the world must therefore be in
the fullest sympathy. Nona, knowing Parker Greg's views, smiled at that
too. Aggie, she was sure, would feel much safer with her other
neighbour, Mr. Herman Toy, who thought, on all subjects, just what all
his fellow capitalists did.
</p>
<p>
Nona caught Stan Heuston's smile, and knew he had read her thought; but
from him too she turned. The last thing she wanted was that he should
guess her real opinion of his wife. Something deep down and dogged in
Nona always, when it came to the touch, made her avert her feet from the
line of least resistance.
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>
Manford lent an absent ear first to one neighbour, then the other. Mrs.
Toy was saying, in her flat uncadenced voice, like tepid water running
into a bath: "I don't see how people can live without lifts in their
houses, do you? But perhaps it's because I've never had to. Father's
house had the first electric lift at Climax. Once, in England, we went
to stay with the Duke of Humber, at Humber Castle—one of those
huge parties, royalties and everything—golf and polo all day, and
a ball every night; and, will you believe it, <i>we had to walk up and
down stairs</i>! I don't know what English people are made of. I suppose
they've never been used to what we call comfort. The second day I told
Herman I couldn't stand those awful slippery stairs after two rounds of
golf, and dancing till four in the morning. It was simply destroying my
heart—the doctor has warned me so often! I wanted to leave right
away—but Herman said it would offend the Duke. The Duke's such a
sweet old man. But, any way, I made Herman promise me a sapphire and
emerald <i>plaque</i> from Cartier's before I'd agree to stick it
out..."
</p>
<p>
The Marchesa's little ferret face with sharp impassioned eyes darted
conversationally forward. "The Duke of Humber? I know him so well. Dear
old man! Ah, you also stayed at Humber? So often he invites me. We are
related ... yes, through his first wife, whose mother was a Venturini
of the Calabrian branch: Donna Ottaviana. Yes. Another sister, Donna
Rosmunda, the beauty of the family, married the Duke of Lepanto ... a
mediatized prince..."
</p>
<p>
She stopped, and Manford read in her eyes the hasty inward
interrogation: "Will they think that expression queer? I'm not sure
myself just what 'mediatized' means. And these Americans! They stick at
nothing, but they're shocked at everything." Aloud she continued: "A
mediatized prince—but a man of the <i>very highest</i> character."
</p>
<p>
"Oh—" murmured Mrs. Toy, puzzled but obviously relieved.
</p>
<p>
Manford's attention, tugging at its moorings, had broken loose again and
was off and away.
</p>
<p>
The how-many-eth dinner did that make this winter? And no end in sight!
How could Pauline stand it? Why did she want to stand it? All those
rest-cures, massages, rhythmic exercises, devised to restore the health
of people who would have been as sound as bells if only they had led
normal lives! Like that fool of a woman spreading her blond splendours
so uselessly at his side, who couldn't walk upstairs because she had danced
all night! Pauline was just like that—never walked upstairs, and
then had to do gymnastics, and have osteopathy, and call in Hindu sages,
to prevent her muscles from getting atrophied... He had a vision of his
mother, out on the Minnesota farm, before they moved into Delos—saw
her sowing, digging potatoes, feeding chickens; saw her kneading,
baking, cooking, washing, mending, catching and harnessing the
half-broken colt to drive twelve miles in the snow for the doctor, one
day when all the men were away, and his little sister had been so badly
scalded... And there the old lady sat at Delos, in her nice little
brick house, in her hale and hearty old age, built to outlive them
all.—Wasn't that perhaps the kind of life Manford himself had been
meant for? Farming on a big scale, with all the modern appliances his
forbears had lacked, outdoing everybody in the county, marketing his
goods at the big centres, and cutting a swathe in state politics like
his elder brother? Using his brains, muscles, the whole of him, body and
soul, to do real things, bring about real results in the world, instead
of all this artificial activity, this spinning around faster and faster
in the void, and having to be continually rested and doctored to make up
for exertions that led to nothing, nothing, nothing...
</p>
<p>
"Of course we all know <i>you</i> could tell us if you would. Everybody
knows the Lindons have gone to you for advice." Mrs. Toy's large shallow
eyes floated the question toward him on a sea-blue wave of curiosity.
"Not a word of truth? Oh, of course you have to say that! But everybody
has been expecting there'd be trouble soon..."
</p>
<p>
And, in a whisper, from the Marchesa's side: "Teasing you about that
mysterious Mahatma? Foolish woman! As long as dear Pauline believes in
him, I'm satisfied. That was what I was saying to Pauline before dinner:
'Whatever you and Dexter approve of, I approve of.' That's the reason
why I'm so anxious to have my poor boy come to New York ... my
Michelangelo! If only you could see him I know you'd grow as fond of him
as you are of our dear Jim: perhaps even take him into your office...
Ah, that, dear Dexter, has always been my dream!"
</p>
<p>
... What sort of a life, after all, if not this one? For of course
that dream of a Western farm was all rubbish. What he really wanted was
a life in which professional interests as far-reaching and absorbing as
his own were somehow impossibly combined with great stretches of country
quiet, books, horses and children—ah, children! Boys of his
own—teaching them all sorts of country things; taking them for long
trudges, telling them about trees and plants and birds—watching the
squirrels, feeding the robins and thrushes in winter; and coming home in
the dusk to firelight, lamplight, a tea-table groaning with jolly
things, all the boys and girls (girls too, more little Nonas) grouped
around, hungry and tingling from their long tramp—and a woman lifting
a calm face from her book: a woman who looked so absurdly young to be
their mother; so—
</p>
<p>
"You're looking at Jim's wife?" The Marchesa broke in. "No wonder!
<i>Très en beauté</i>, our Lita!—that dress, the very same
colour as her hair, and those Indian emeralds ... how clever of her! But
a little difficult to talk to? Little too silent? No? Ah, not to
<i>you</i>, perhaps—her dear father! Father-in-law, I mean—"
</p>
<p>
Silent! The word sent him off again. For in that other world, so ringing
with children's laughter, children's wrangles, and all the healthy
blustering noises of country life in a big family, there would somehow,
underneath it all, be a great pool of silence, a reservoir on which one
could always draw and flood one's soul with peace. The vision was vague
and contradictory, but it all seemed to meet and mingle in the woman's
eyes...
</p>
<p>
Pauline was signalling from her table-end. He rose and offered his arm
to the Marchesa.
</p>
<p>
In the hall the strains of the famous Somaliland orchestra bumped and
tossed downstairs from the ball-room to meet them. The ladies, headed by
Mrs. Toy, flocked to the mirror-lined lift dissembled behind forced
lilacs and Japanese plums; but Amalasuntha, on Manford's arm, set her
blunt black slipper on the marble tread.
</p>
<p>
"I'm used to Roman palaces!"

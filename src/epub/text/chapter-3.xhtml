			<p class="drop-cap">AT a quarter past one, when Nona arrived at her half-brother's house, she was told that Mrs. Wyant was not yet down.</p>
			<p>"And Mr. Wyant not yet up, I suppose? From his office, I mean," she added, as the young butler looked his surprise.</p>
			<p>Pauline Manford had been very generous at the time of her son's marriage. She was relieved at his settling down, and at his seeming to understand that marriage connoted the choice of a profession, and the adoption of what people called regular habits. Not that Jim's irregularities had ever been such as the phrase habitually suggests. They had chiefly consisted in his not being able to make up his mind what to do with his life (so like his poor father, that!), in his always forgetting what time it was, or what engagements his mother had made for him, in his wanting a chemical laboratory fitted up for him at Cedarledge, and then, when it was all done, using it first as a kennel for breeding fox-terriers and then as a quiet place to practise the violin.</p>
			<p>Nona knew how sorely these vacillations had tried her mother, and how reassured Mrs. Manford had been when the young man, in the heat of his infatuation for Lita, had vowed that if she would have him he would turn to and grind in an office like all the other husbands.</p>
			<p><i>Lita have him</i>! Lita Cliffe, a portionless orphan, with no one to guide her in the world but a harum-scarum and somewhat blown-upon aunt, the "impossible" Mrs. Percy Landish! Mrs. Manford smiled at her son's modesty while she applauded his good resolutions. "This experience has made a man of dear Jim," she said, mildly triumphing in the latest confirmation of her optimism. "If only it lasts—!" she added, relapsing into human uncertainty.</p>
			<p>"Oh, it will, mother; you'll see; as long as Lita doesn't get tired of him," Nona had assured her.</p>
			<p>"As long—? But, my dear child, why should Lita ever get tired of him? You seem to forget what a miracle it was that a girl like Lita, with no one but poor Kitty Landish to look after her, should ever have got such a husband!"</p>
			<p>Nona held her ground. "Well—just look about you, mother! Don't they almost all get tired of each other? And when they do, will anything ever stop their having another try? Think of your big dinners! Doesn't Maisie always have to make out a list of previous marriages as long as a cross-word puzzle, to prevent your calling people by the wrong names?"</p>
			<p>Mrs. Manford waved away the challenge. "Jim and Lita are not like that; and I don't like your way of speaking of divorce, Nona," she had added, rather weakly for her—since, as Nona might have reminded her, her own way of speaking of divorce varied disconcertingly with the time, the place and the divorce.</p>
			<p>The young girl had leisure to recall this discussion while she sat and waited for her brother and his wife. In the freshly decorated and studiously empty house there seemed to be no one to welcome her. The baby (whom she had first enquired for) was asleep, his mother hardly awake, and the head of the house still "at the office." Nona looked about the drawing-room and wondered—the habit was growing on her.</p>
			<p>The drawing-room (it suddenly occurred to her) was very expressive of the modern marriage state. It looked, for all its studied effects, its rather nervous attention to "values," complementary colours, and the things the modern decorator lies awake over, more like the waiting-room of a glorified railway station than the setting of an established way of life. Nothing in it seemed at home or at ease—from the early kakemono of a bearded sage, on walls of pale buff silk, to the three mourning irises isolated in a white Sung vase in the desert of an otherwise empty table. The only life in the room was contributed by the agitations of the exotic goldfish in a huge spherical aquarium; and they too were but transients, since Lita insisted on having the aquarium illuminated night and day with electric bulbs, and the sleepless fish were always dying off and having to be replaced.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Manford had paid for the house and its decoration. It was not what she would have wished for herself—she had not yet quite caught up with the new bareness and selectiveness. But neither would she have wished the young couple to live in the opulent setting of tapestries and "period" furniture which she herself preferred. Above all she wanted them to keep up; to do what the other young couples were doing; she had even digested—in one huge terrified gulp—Lita's black boudoir, with its welter of ebony velvet cushions overlooked by a statue as to which Mrs. Manford could only minimize the indecency by saying that she understood it was Cubist. But she did think it unkind—after all she had done—to have Nona suggest that Lita might get tired of Jim!</p>
			<p>The idea had never really troubled Nona—at least not till lately. Even now she had nothing definite in her mind. Nothing beyond the vague question: what would a woman like Lita be likely to do if she suddenly grew tired of the life she was leading? But that question kept coming back so often that she had really wanted, that morning, to consult her mother about it; for who else was there to consult? Arthur Wyant? Why, poor Arthur had never been able to manage his own poor little concerns with any sort of common sense or consistency; and at the suggestion that any one might tire of Jim he would be as indignant as Mrs. Manford, and without her power of controlling her emotions.</p>
			<p>Dexter Manford? Well—Dexter Manford's daughter had to admit that it really wasn't his business if his step-son's marriage threatened to be a failure; and besides, Nona knew how overwhelmed with work her father always was, and hesitated to lay this extra burden on him. For it would be a burden. Manford was very fond of Jim (as indeed they all were), and had been extremely kind to him. It was entirely owing to Manford's influence that Jim, who was regarded as vague and unreliable, had got such a good berth in the Amalgamated Trust Co.; and Manford had been much pleased at the way in which the boy had stuck to his job. Just like Jim, Nona thought tenderly—if ever you could induce him to do anything at all, he always did it with such marvellous neatness and persistency. And the incentive of working for Lita and the boy was enough to anchor him to his task for life.</p>
			<p>A new scent—unrecognizable but exquisite. In its wake came Lita Wyant, half-dancing, half-drifting, fastening a necklace, humming a tune, her little round head, with the goldfish-coloured hair, the mother-of-pearl complexion and screwed-up auburn eyes, turning sideways like a bird's on her long throat. She was astonished but delighted to see Nona, indifferent to her husband's non-arrival, and utterly unaware that lunch had been waiting for half an hour.</p>
			<p>"I had a sandwich and a cocktail after my exercises. I don't suppose it's time for me to be hungry again," she conjectured. "But perhaps you are, you poor child. Have you been waiting long?"</p>
			<p>"Not much! I know you too well to be punctual," Nona laughed.</p>
			<p>Lita widened her eyes. "Are you suggesting that I'm not? Well, then, how about your ideal brother?"</p>
			<p>"He's down town working to keep a roof over your head and your son's."</p>
			<p>Lita shrugged. "Oh, a roof—I don't care much for roofs, do you—or is it <i>rooves</i>? Not this one, at any rate." She caught Nona by the shoulders, held her at arm's-length, and with tilted head and persuasively narrowed eyes, demanded: "This room is <i>awful</i>, isn't it? Now acknowledge that it is! And Jim won't give me the money to do it over."</p>
			<p>"Do it over? But, Lita, you did it exactly as you pleased two years ago!"</p>
			<p>"Two years ago? Do you mean to say you like anything that you liked two years ago?"</p>
			<p>"Yes—you!" Nona retorted: adding rather helplessly: "And, besides, everybody admires the room so much—." She stopped, feeling that she was talking exactly like her mother.</p>
			<p>Lita's little hands dropped in a gesture of despair. "That's just it! <i>Everybody</i> admires it. Even Mrs. Manford does. And when you think what sort of things <i>Everybody</i> admires! What's the use of pretending, Nona? It's the typical <i>cliché</i> drawing-room. Every one of the couples who were married the year we were has one like it. The first time Tommy Ardwin saw it—you know he's the new decorator—he said: 'Gracious, how familiar all this seems!' and began to whistle '<i>Home, Sweet Home</i>'!"</p>
			<p>"But of course he would, you simpleton! When what he wants is to be asked to do it over!"</p>
			<p>Lita heaved a sigh. "If he only could! Perhaps he might reconcile me to this house. But I don't believe anybody could do that." She glanced about her with an air of ineffable disgust. "I'd like to throw everything in it into the street. I've been so bored here."</p>
			<p>Nona laughed. "You'd be bored anywhere. I wish another Tommy Ardwin would come along and tell you what an old <i>cliché</i> being bored is."</p>
			<p>"An old <i>cliché</i>? Why shouldn't it be? When life itself is such a bore? You can't redecorate life!"</p>
			<p>"If you could, what would you begin by throwing into the street? The baby?"</p>
			<p>Lita's eyes woke to fire. "Don't be an idiot! You know I adore my baby."</p>
			<p>"Well—then Jim?"</p>
			<p>"You know I adore my Jim!" echoed the young wife, mimicking her own emotion.</p>
			<p>"Hullo—that sounds ominous!" Jim Wyant came in, clearing the air with his fresh good-humoured presence. "I fear my bride when she says she adores me," he said, taking Nona into a brotherly embrace.</p>
			<p>As he stood there, sturdy and tawny, a trifle undersized, with his bright blue eyes and short blunt-nosed face, in which everything was so handsomely modelled and yet so safe and sober, Nona fell again to her dangerous wondering. Something had gone out of his face—all the wild uncertain things, the violin, model-making, inventing, dreaming, vacillating—everything she had best loved except the twinkle in his sobered eyes. Whatever else was left now was all plain utility. Well, better so, no doubt—when one looked at Lita! Her glance caught her sister-in-law's face in a mirror between two panels, and the reflection of her own beside it; she winced a little at the contrast. At her best she had none of that milky translucence, or of the long lines which made Lita seem in perpetual motion, as a tremor of air lives in certain trees. Though Nona was as tall and nearly as slim, she seemed to herself to be built, while Lita was spun of spray and sunlight. Perhaps it was Nona's general brownness—she had Dexter Manford's brown crinkled hair, his strong black lashes setting her rather usual-looking gray eyes; and the texture of her dusky healthy skin, compared to Lita's, seemed rough and opaque. The comparison added to her general vague sense of discouragement. "It's not one of my beauty days," she thought.</p>
			<p>Jim was drawing her arm through his. "Come along, my girl. Is there going to be any lunch?" he queried, turning toward the dining-room.</p>
			<p>"Oh, probably. In this house the same things always happen every day," Lita averred with a slight grimace.</p>
			<p>"Well, I'm glad lunch does—on the days when I can make a dash up-town for it."</p>
			<p>"On others Lita eats goldfish food," Nona laughed.</p>
			<p>"Luncheon is served, madam," the butler announced.</p>
			<p>The meal, as usual under Lita's roof, was one in which delicacies alternated with delays. Mrs. Manford would have been driven out of her mind by the uncertainties of the service and the incoherence of the <i>menu</i>; but she would have admitted that no one did a pilaff better than Lita's cook. Gastronomic refinements were wasted on Jim, whose indifference to the possession of the Wyant madeira was one of his father's severest trials. ("I shouldn't have been surprised if <i>you</i> hadn't cared, Nona; after all, you're a Manford; but that a Wyant shouldn't have a respect for old wine!" Arthur Wyant often lamented to her.) As for Lita, she either nibbled languidly at new health foods, or made ravenous inroads into the most indigestible dish presented to her. To-day she leaned back, dumb and indifferent, while Jim devoured what was put before him as if unaware that it was anything but canned beef; and Nona watched the two under guarded lids.</p>
			<p>The telephone tinkled, and the butler announced: "Mr. Manford, madam."</p>
			<p>Nona Manford looked up. "For me?"</p>
			<p>"No, miss; Mrs. Wyant."</p>
			<p>Lita was on her feet, suddenly animated. "Oh, all right... Don't wait for me," she flung over her shoulder as she made for the door.</p>
			<p>"Have the receiver brought in here," Jim suggested; but she brushed by without heeding.</p>
			<p>"That's something new—Lita sprinting for the telephone!" Jim laughed.</p>
			<p>"And to talk to father!" For the life of her, Nona could not have told why she stopped short with a vague sense of embarrassment. Dexter Manford had always been very kind to his stepson's wife; but then everybody was kind to Lita.</p>
			<p>Jim's head was bent over the pilaff; he took it down in quick undiscerning mouthfuls.</p>
			<p>"Well, I hope he's saying something that will amuse her: nothing seems to, nowadays."</p>
			<p>It was on the tip of Nona's tongue to rejoin: "Oh, yes; it amuses her to say that nothing amuses her." But she looked at her brother's face, faintly troubled under its surface serenity, and refrained.</p>
			<p>Instead, she remarked on the beauty of the two yellow arums in a bronze jar reflected in the mahogany of the dining-table. "Lita has a genius for flowers."</p>
			<p>"And for everything else—when she chooses!"</p>
			<p>The door opened and Lita sauntered back and dropped into her seat. She shook her head disdainfully at the proffered pilaff. There was a pause.</p>
			<p>"Well—what's the news?" Jim asked.</p>
			<p>His wife arched her exquisite brows. "News? I expect you to provide that. I'm only just awake."</p>
			<p>"I mean—" But he broke off, and signed to the butler to remove his plate. There was another pause; then Lita's little head turned on its long interrogative neck toward Nona. "It seems we're banqueting tonight at the Palazzo Manford. Did you know?"</p>
			<p>"Did I know? Why, Lita! I've heard of nothing else for weeks. It's the annual feast for the Marchesa."</p>
			<p>"I was never told," said Lita calmly. "I'm afraid I'm engaged."</p>
			<p>Jim lifted his head with a jerk. "You were told a fortnight ago."</p>
			<p>"Oh, a fortnight! That's too long to remember anything. It's like Nona's telling me that I ought to admire my drawing-room because I admired it two years ago."</p>
			<p>Her husband reddened to the roots of his tawny hair. "Don't you admire it?" he asked, with a sort of juvenile dismay.</p>
			<p>"There; Lita'll be happy now—she's produced her effect!" Nona laughed a little nervously.</p>
			<p>Lita joined in the laugh. "Isn't he like his mother?" she shrugged.</p>
			<p>Jim was silent, and his sister guessed that he was afraid to insist on the dinner engagement lest he should increase his wife's determination to ignore it. The same motive kept Nona from saying anything more; and the lunch ended in a clatter of talk about other things. But what puzzled Nona was that her father's communication to Lita should have concerned the fact that she was dining at his house that night. It was unlike Dexter Manford to remember the fact himself (as Miss Bruss's frantic telephoning had testified), and still more unlike him to remind his wife's guests, even if he knew who they were to be—which he seldom did. Nona pondered. "They must have been going somewhere together—he told me he was engaged tonight—and Lita's in a temper because they can't. But then she's in a temper about everything today." Nona tried to make that cover all her perplexities. She wondered if it did as much for Jim.</p>

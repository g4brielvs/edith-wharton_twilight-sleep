PAULINE sat up suddenly in bed. It was as if an invisible hand had
touched a spring in her spinal column, and set her upright in the
darkness before she was aware of any reason for it.
</p>
<p>
No doubt she had heard something through her sleep; but what? She
listened for a repetition of the sound.
</p>
<p>
All was silence. She stretched out her hand to an onyx knob on the table
by her bed, and instantly the face of a miniature clock was illuminated,
and the hour chimed softly; two strokes followed by one. Half-past
two—the silentest hour of the night; and in the vernal hush of
Cedarledge! Yet certainly there had been a sound—a sharp explosive
sound... Again! There it was: a revolver shot ... somewhere in the
house...
</p>
<p>
Burglars?
</p>
<p>
Her feet were in her slippers, her hand on the electric light switch.
All the while she continued to listen intently. Dead silence everywhere...
</p>
<p>
But how had burglars got in without starting the alarm? Ah—she
remembered! Powder had orders never to set it while any one was out of
the house; it was Dexter who should have seen that it was connected when
he got back from Greystock with Lita. And naturally he had forgotten to.
</p>
<p>
Pauline was on her feet, her hair smoothed back under her fillet-shaped
cap of silver lace, her "rest-gown" of silvery silk slipped over her
night-dress. This emergency garb always lay at her bedside in case of
nocturnal alarms, and she was equipped in an instant, and had already
reconnected the burglar-alarm, and sounded the general summons for
Powder, the footmen, the gardeners and chauffeurs. Her hand played
irresolutely over the complicated knobs of the glittering switchboard
which filled a panel of her dressing-room; then she pressed the button
marked "Engine-house." Why not? There had been a series of bad suburban
burglaries lately, and one never knew... It was just as well to rouse
the neighbourhood... Dexter was so careless. Very likely he had left
the front door open.
</p>
<p>
Silence still—profounder than ever. Not a sound since that second
shot, if shot it was. Very softly she opened her door and paused in the
anteroom between her room and her husband's. "Dexter!" she called.
</p>
<p>
No answer; no responding flash of light. Men slept so heavily. She
opened, lighted—"Dexter!"
</p>
<p>
The room was empty, her husband's bed unslept in. But then—what?
Those sounds of his return? Had she been dreaming when she thought she
heard them? Or was it the burglars she had heard, looting his room, a
few feet off from where she lay? In spite of her physical courage a
shiver ran over her...
</p>
<p>
But if Dexter and Lita were not yet back, whence had the sound of the
shot come, and who had fired it? She trembled at the thought of
Nona—Nona and the baby! They were alone with the baby's nurse on the
farther side of the house. And the house seemed suddenly so immense, so
resonant, so empty...
</p>
<p>
In the shadowy corridor outside her room she paused again for a second,
straining her ears for a guiding sound; then she sped on, pushing back
the swinging door which divided the farther wing from hers, turning on
the lights with a flying hand as she ran... On the deeply carpeted
floors her foot-fall made no sound, and she had the sense of skimming
over the ground inaudibly, like something ghostly, disembodied, which
had no power to break the hush and make itself heard...
</p>
<p>
Half way down the passage she was startled to see the door of Lita's
bedroom open. Sounds at last—sounds low, confused and
terrified—issued from it. What kind of sounds? Pauline could not
tell; they were rushing together in a vortex in her brain. She heard
herself scream "Help!" with the strangled voice of a nightmare, and was
comforted to feel the rush of other feet behind her: Powder, the
men-servants, the maids. Thank God the system worked! Whatever she was
coming to, at least they would be there to help...
</p>
<p>
She reached the door, pushed it—and it unexpectedly resisted. Some
one was clinging to it on the inner side, struggling to hold it shut, to
prevent her entering. She threw herself against it with all her
strength, and saw her husband's arm and hand in the gap. "Dexter!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, God." He fell back, and the door with him. Pauline went in.
</p>
<p>
All the lights were on—the room was a glare. Another man stood
shivering and staring in a corner, but Pauline hardly noticed him, for
before her on the floor lay Lita's long body, in a loose spangled robe,
flung sobbing over another body.
</p>
<p>
"Nona—Nona!" the mother screamed, rushing forward to where they lay.
</p>
<p>
She swept past her husband, dragged Lita back, was on her knees on the
floor, her child pressed to her, Nona's fallen head against her breast,
Nona's blood spattering the silvery folds of the rest-gown, destroying
it forever as a symbol of safety and repose.
</p>
<p>
"Nona—child! What's happened? Are you hurt? Dexter—for pity's
sake! Nona, look at me! It's mother, darling, mother—"
</p>
<p>
Nona's eyes opened with a flutter. Her face was ashen-white, and empty
as a baby's. Slowly she met her mother's agonized stare. "All right ...
only winged me." Her gaze wavered about the disordered room, lifting
and dropping in a butterfly's bewildered flight. Lita lay huddled on the
couch in her spangles, twisted and emptied, like a festal garment flung
off by its wearer. Manford stood between, his face a ruin. In the corner
stood that other man, shrinking, motionless. Pauline's eyes, following
her child's, travelled on to him.
</p>
<p>
"Arthur!" she gasped out, and felt Nona's feeble pressure on her arm.
</p>
<p>
"Don't ... don't... It was an accident. Father—an accident!
<i>Father</i>!"
</p>
<p>
The door of the room was wide now, and Powder stood there, unnaturally
thin and gaunt in his improvised collarless garb, marshalling the gaping
footmen, with gardeners, chauffeurs and maids crowding the corridor
behind them. It was really marvellous, how Pauline's system had worked.
</p>
<p>
Manford turned to Arthur Wyant, his stony face white with revenge. Wyant
still stood motionless, his arms hanging down, his body emptied of all
its strength, a broken word that sounded like "honour" stumbling from
his bedraggled lips.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Father</i>!" At Nona's faint cry Manford's arm fell to his side also,
and he stood there as powerless and motionless as the other.
</p>
<p>
"All an accident ..." breathed from the white lips against Pauline.
</p>
<p>
Powder had stepped forward. His staccato orders rang back over his
shoulder. "Ring up the doctor. Have a car ready. Scour the gardens...
One of the women here! Madam's maid!"
</p>
<p>
Manford suddenly roused himself and swung about with dazed eyes on the
disheveled group in the doorway. "Damn you, what are you doing here, all
of you? Get out—get out, the lot of you! Get out, I say! Can't you
hear me?"
</p>
<p>
Powder bent a respectful but controlling eye on his employer. "Yes, sir;
certainly, sir. I only wish to state that the burglar's mode of entrance
has already been discovered." Manford met this with an unseeing stare,
but the butler continued imperturbably: "Thanks to the rain, sir. He got
in through the pantry window; the latch was forced, and there's muddy
footprints on my linoleum, sir. A tramp was noticed hanging about this
afternoon. I can give evidence—"
</p>
<p>
He darted swiftly between the two men, bent to the floor, and picked up
something which he slipped quickly and secretly into his pocket. A
moment later he had cleared his underlings from the threshold, and the
door was shut on them and him.
</p>
<p>
"Dexter," Pauline cried, "help me to lift her to the bed."
</p>
<p>
Outside, through the watchful hush of the night, a rattle and roar came
up the drive. It filled the silence with an unnatural clamour, immense,
mysterious and menacing. It was the Cedarledge fire-brigade, arriving
double quick in answer to their benefactress's summons.
</p>
<p>
Pauline, bending over her daughter's face, fancied she caught a wan
smile on it...

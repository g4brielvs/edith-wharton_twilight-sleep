AT the gates of Cedarledge Pauline lifted her head from a last hurried
study of the letters and papers Maisie Bruss had thrust into the motor.
</p>
<p>
The departure from town had been tumultuous. Up to the last minute there
had been the usual rush and trepidation, Maisie hanging on the
footboard, Powder and the maid hurrying down with final messages and
recommendations.
</p>
<p>
"Here's another batch of bills passed by the architect, Mrs. Manford.
And he asks if you'd mind—"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, yes; draw another cheque for five thousand, Maisie, and send it to
me with the others to be signed."
</p>
<p>
"And the estimates for the new orchid-house. The contractor says
building-materials are going up again next week, and he can't guarantee,
unless you telephone at once—"
</p>
<p>
"Has madame the jewel-box? I put it under the rug myself, with madame's
motor-bag."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you, Cécile. Yes, it's here."
</p>
<p>
"And is the Maison Herminie to deliver the green and gold teagown here
or—"
</p>
<p>
"Here are the proofs of the Birth Control speech, Mrs. Manford. If you
could just glance over them in the motor, and let me have them back
tonight—"
</p>
<p>
"The Marchesa, madam, has called up to ask if you and Mr. Manford can
receive her at Cedarledge for the next week-end—"
</p>
<p>
"No, Powder; say no. I'm dreadfully sorry..."
</p>
<p>
"Very good, madam. I understand it was to bring a favourable answer from
the Cardinal—"
</p>
<p>
"Oh; very well. I'll see. I'll telephone from Cedarledge."
</p>
<p>
"Please, madam, Mr. Wyant's just telephoned—"
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Wyant, Powder?"
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Arthur Wyant, madam. To ask—"
</p>
<p>
"But Mr. Wyant and Mr. James were to have started for Georgia last
night."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, madam; but Mr. James was detained by business, and now Mr. Arthur
Wyant asks if you'll please ring up before they leave tonight."
</p>
<p>
"Very well. (What can have happened, Nona? You don't know?) Say I've
started for Cedarledge, Powder; I'll ring up from there. Yes; that's
all."
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Manford, wait! Here are two more telegrams, and a special—"
</p>
<p>
"Take care, Maisie; you'll slip and break your leg..."
</p>
<p>
"Yes; but Mrs. Manford! The special is from Mrs. Swoffer. She says the
committee have just discovered a new genius, and they're calling an
emergency meeting for tomorrow afternoon at three, and couldn't you
possibly—"
</p>
<p>
"No, no, Maisie—I can't! Say I've <i>left</i>—"
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>
The waves of agitation were slow in subsiding. A glimpse, down a side
street, of the Marchesa's cheap boarding-house-hotel, revived them; and
so did the flash past the inscrutable "Dawnside," aloof on its height
above the Hudson. But as the motor slid over the wide suburban
Boulevards, and out into the budding country, with the roar and menace
of the city fading harmlessly away on the horizon, Pauline's serenity
gradually stole back.
</p>
<p>
Nona, at her side, sat silent; and the mother was grateful for that
silence. She had noticed that the girl had looked pale and drawn for the
last fortnight; but that was just another proof of how much they all
needed the quiet of Cedarledge.
</p>
<p>
"You don't know why Jim and his father have put off starting, Nona?"
</p>
<p>
"No idea, mother. Probably business of Jim's, as Powder said."
</p>
<p>
"Do you know why his father wants to telephone me?"
</p>
<p>
"Not a bit. Probably it's not important. I'll call up this evening."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, if you would, dear! I'm really tired."
</p>
<p>
There was a pause, and then Nona questioned: "Have you noticed Maisie,
mother? She's pretty tired too."
</p>
<p>
"Yes; poor Maisie! Preparing Cedarledge has been rather a rush for her,
I'm afraid—"
</p>
<p>
"It's not only that. She's just been told that her mother has a cancer."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, poor child! How dreadful! She never said a word to me—"
</p>
<p>
"No, she wouldn't."
</p>
<p>
"But, Nona, have you told her to see Disterman <i>at once</i>? Perhaps an
immediate operation ... you must call her up as soon as we arrive.
Tell her, of course, that I'll bear all the expenses—"
</p>
<p>
After that they both relapsed into silence.
</p>
<p>
These domestic tragedies happened now and then. One would have given the
world to avert them; but when one couldn't one was always ready to foot
the bill... Pauline wished that she had known ... had had time to
say a kindly word to poor Maisie... Perhaps she would have to give her
a week off; or at least a couple of days, while she settled her mother
in the hospital. At least, if Disterman advised an operation...
</p>
<p>
It was dreadful, how rushed one always was. Pauline would have liked to
go and see poor Mrs. Bruss herself. But there were Dexter and Lita and
the baby all arriving the day after tomorrow, and only just time to put
the last touches to Cedarledge before they came. And Pauline herself was
desperately tired, though she had taken a "triple treatment" from Alvah
Loft ($100) that very morning.
</p>
<p>
She always meant to be kind to every one dependent on her; it was only
time that lacked—always time! Dependents and all, they were swept
away with her in the same ceaseless rush. When now and then one of them
dropped by the way she was sorry, and sent back first aid, and did all
she could; but the rush never stopped; it couldn't stop; when one did a
kindness one could only fling it at its object and whirl by.
</p>
<p>
The blessèd peace of the country! Pauline drew a deep breath of
content. Never before had she approached Cedarledge with so complete a
sense of possessorship. The place was really of her own making, for
though the house had been built and the grounds laid out years before
she had acquired the property, she had stamped her will and her wealth
on every feature. Pauline was persuaded that she was fond of the
country—but what she was really fond of was doing things to the
country, and owning, with this object, as many acres of it as possible.
And so it had come about that every year the Cedarledge estate had
pushed the encircling landscape farther back, and substituted for its
miles of golden-rod and birch and maple more acres of glossy lawn, and
more specimen limes and oaks and cut-leaved beeches, domed over more and
more windings of expensive shrubbery.
</p>
<p>
From the farthest gate it was now a drive of two miles to the house, and
Pauline found even this too short for her minutely detailed appreciation
of what lay between her and her threshold. In the village, the glint of
the gilt weathercock on the new half-timbered engine-house; under a rich
slope of pasture-land the recently enlarged dairy-farm; then woods of
hemlock and dogwood; acres of rhododendron, azalea and mountain laurel
acclimatized about a hidden lake; a glimpse of Japanese water-gardens
fringed with cherry bloom and catkins; open lawns, spreading trees, the
long brick house-front and its terraces, and through a sculptured
archway the Dutch garden with dwarf topiary work and endless files of
bulbs about the commander's baton of a stately sundial.
</p>
<p>
To Pauline each tree, shrub, water-course, herbaceous border, meant not
only itself, but the surveying of grades, transporting of soil,
tunnelling for drainage, conducting of water, the business
correspondence and paying of bills, which had preceded its existence;
and she would have cared for it far less—perhaps not at all—had
it sprung into being unassisted, like the random shadbushes and wild cherry
trees beyond the gates.
</p>
<p>
The faint spring loveliness reached her somehow, in long washes of pale
green, and the blurred mauve of budding vegetation; but her eyes could
not linger on any particular beauty without its dissolving into soil,
manure, nurserymen's catalogues, and bills again—bills. It had all
cost a terrible lot of money; but she was proud of that too—to her
it was part of the beauty, part of the exquisite order and suitability
which reigned as much in the simulated wildness of the rhododendron glen
as in the geometrical lines of the Dutch garden.
</p>
<p>
"Seventy-five thousand bulbs this year!" she thought, as the motor swept
by the sculptured gateway, just giving and withdrawing a flash of turf
sheeted with amber and lilac, in a setting of twisted and scalloped
evergreens.
</p>
<p>
Twenty-five thousand more bulbs than last year ... that was how she
liked it to be. It was exhilarating to spend more money each year, to be
always enlarging and improving, in small ways as well as great, to face
unexpected demands with promptness and energy, beat down exorbitant
charges, struggle through difficult moments, and come out at the end of
the year tired but victorious, with improvements made, bills paid, and a
reassuring balance in the bank. To Pauline that was "life."
</p>
<p>
And how her expenditure at Cedarledge was justifying itself! Her
husband, drawn by its fresh loveliness, had voluntarily given up his
annual trip to California, the excitement of tarpon-fishing, the
independence of bachelorhood—all to spend a quiet month in the
country with his wife and children. Pauline felt that even the twenty-five
thousand additional bulbs had had a part in shaping his decision. And
what would he say when he saw the new bathrooms, assisted at the village
fire-drill, and plunged into the artificially warmed waters of the new
swimming pool? A mist of happiness rose to her eyes as she looked out on
the spring-misted landscape.
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>
Nona had not followed her mother into the house. Her dogs at her heels,
she plunged down hill to the woods and lake. She knew nothing of what
Cedarledge had cost, but little of the labour of its making. It was
simply the world of her childhood, and she could see it from no other
angle, nor imagine it as ever having been different. To her it had
always worn the same enchantment, stretched to the same remote
distances. At nineteen it was almost the last illusion she had left.
</p>
<p>
In the path by the lake she felt herself drawn back under the old spell.
Those budding branches, the smell of black peaty soil quivering with
life, the woodlands faintly starred with dogwood, all were the setting
of childish adventures, old games with Jim, Indian camps on the
willow-fringed island, and innocent descents among the rhododendrons to
boat or bathe by moonlight.
</p>
<p>
The old skiff had escaped Mrs. Manford's annual "doing-up" and still
leaked through the same rusty seams. Pushing out upon the lake, Nona
leaned on the oars and let the great mockery of the spring dilate her
heart...
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>
Manford questioned: "All right, eh? Warm enough? Not going too fast? The
air's still sharp up here in the hills;" and Lita settled down beside
him into one of the deep silences that enfolded her as softly as her
furs. By turning his head a little he could just see the tip of her nose
and the curve of her upper lip between hat-brim and silver fox; and the
sense of her, so close and so still, sunk in that warm animal hush which
he always found so restful, dispelled his last uneasiness, and made her
presence at his side seem as safe and natural as his own daughter's.
</p>
<p>
"Just as well you sent the boy by train, though—I foresaw I'd get off
too late to suit the young gentleman's hours."
</p>
<p>
She curled down more deeply at his side, with a contented laugh.
</p>
<p>
Manford, intent on the steering wheel, restrained the impulse to lay a
hand over hers, and kept his profile steadily turned to her. It was
wonderful, how successfully his plan was working out ... how
reasonable she'd been about it in the end. Poor child! No doubt she
would always be reasonable with people who knew how to treat her. And he
flattered himself that he did. It hadn't been easy, just at first—but
now he'd struck the right note and meant to hold it. Not paternal,
exactly: she would have been the first to laugh at anything as
old-fashioned as that. Heavy fathers had gone out with the rest of the
<i>tremolo</i> effects. No; but elder brotherly. That was it. The same free
and friendly relation which existed, say, between Jim and Nona. Why, he had
actually tried chaffing Lita, and she hadn't minded—he had made fun
of that ridiculous Ardwin, and she had just laughed and shrugged. That
little shrug—when her white shoulder, as the dress slipped from it,
seemed to be pushing up into a wing! There was something birdlike and
floating in all her motions... Poor child, poor little girl... He
really felt like her elder brother; and his looking-glass told him that
he didn't look much too old for the part...
</p>
<p>
The sense of having just grazed something dark and lurid, which had
threatened to submerge them, gave him an added feeling of security, a
holiday feeling, as if life stretched before him as safe and open as his
coming fortnight at Cedarledge. How glad he was that he had given up his
tarpon-fishing, managed to pack Jim and Wyant off to Georgia, and
secured this peaceful interval in which to look about him and take stock
of things before the grind began again!
</p>
<p>
The day before yesterday—just after Pauline's departure—it had
seemed as if all their plans would be wrecked by one of Wyant's fits of
crankiness. Wyant always enjoyed changing his mind after every one
else's was made up; and at the last moment he had telephoned to say that
he wasn't well enough to go south. He had rung up Pauline first, and
being told that she had left had communicated with Jim; and Jim,
distracted, had appealed to Manford. It was one of his father's usual
attacks of "nervousness"; cousin Eleanor had seen it coming, and tried
to cut down the whiskies-and-sodas; finally Jim begged Manford to drop
in and reason with his predecessor.
</p>
<p>
These visits always produced a profound impression on Wyant; Manford
himself, for all his professional acuteness, couldn't quite measure the
degree or guess the nature of the effect, but he felt his power, and
preserved it by seeing Wyant as seldom as possible. This time, however,
it seemed as if things might not go as smoothly as usual. Wyant, who
looked gaunt and excited, tried to carry off the encounter with the
jauntiness he always assumed in Manford's presence. "My dear fellow! Sit
down, do. Cigar? Always delighted to see my successor. Any little hints
I can give about the management of the concern—"
</p>
<p>
It was his usual note, but exaggerated, overemphasized, lacking the
Wyant touch—and he had gone on: "Though why the man who has failed
should offer advice to the man who has succeeded, I don't know. Well, in
this case it's about Jim... Yes, you're as fond of Jim as I am, I
know... Still, he's <i>my</i> son, eh? Well, I'm not satisfied that it's
a good thing to take him away from his wife at this particular moment.
Know I'm old-fashioned, of course ... all the musty old traditions have
been superseded. You and your set have seen to that—introduced the
breezy code of the prairies... But my son's my son; he wasn't brought up
in the new way, and, damn it all, Manford, you understand; well,
no—I suppose there are some things you never <i>will</i>
understand, no matter how devilish clever you are, and how many millions
you've made."
</p>
<p>
The apple-cart had been near upsetting; but if Manford didn't understand
poor Wyant's social code he did know how to keep his temper when it was
worth while, and how to talk to a weak overexcited man who had been
drinking too hard, and who took no exercise.
</p>
<p>
"Worried about Jim, eh? Yes—I don't wonder. I am too. Fact is, Jim's
worked himself to a standstill, and I feel partly responsible for it,
for I put him onto that job at the bank, and he's been doing it too
well—overdoing it. That's the whole trouble, and that's why I feel
responsible to you all for getting him away as soon as possible, and
letting him have a complete holiday... Jim's young—a fortnight off
will straighten him out. But you're the only person who can get him away
from his wife and baby, and wherever Lita is there'll be jazz and
nonsense, and bills and bothers; that's why his mother and I have
offered to take the lady on for a while, and give him his chance. As man
to man, Wyant, I think we two ought to stand together and see this thing
through. If we do, I guarantee everything will come out right. Do you good
too—being off like that with your boy, in a good climate, loafing
on the beach and watching Jim recuperate. Wish I could run down and join
you—and I don't say I won't make a dash for it, just for a week-end,
if I can break away from the family. A-1 fishing at the island—and I
know you used to be a great fisherman. As for Lita, she'll be safe enough
with Pauline and Nona."
</p>
<p>
The trick was done.
</p>
<p>
But why think of it as a trick, when at the time he had meant every word
he spoke? Jim <i>was</i> dead-beat—<i>did</i> need a
change—and yet could only have been got away on the pretext of
having to take his father south. Queer, how in some inner fold of one's
conscience a collection of truths could suddenly seem to look like a
tissue of lies! ... Lord, but what morbid rubbish! Manford was on his
honour to make the whole thing turn out as true as it sounded, and he
was going to. And there was an end of it. And here was Cedarledge. The
drive hadn't lasted a minute...
</p>
<p>
How lovely the place looked in the twilight, a haze of tender tints
melting into shadow, the long dark house-front already gemmed with
orange panes!
</p>
<p>
"You'll like it, won't you, Lita?" A purr of content at his elbow.
</p>
<p>
If only Pauline would have the sense to leave him alone, let him enjoy
it all in Lita's lazy inarticulate way, not cram him with statistics and
achievements, with expenditures and results. He was so tired of her
perpetual stock-taking, her perpetual rendering of accounts and
reckoning up of interest. He admired it all, of course—he admired
Pauline herself more than ever. But he longed to let himself sink into
the spring sweetness as a man might sink on a woman's breast, and just
feel her quiet hands in his hair.
</p>
<p>
"There's the dogwood! Look! Never seen it in bloom here before, have
you? It's one of our sights." He had counted a good deal on the effect
of the dogwood. "Well, here we are—Jove, but it's good to be here!
Why, child, I believe you've been asleep..." He lifted her, still
half-drowsing, from the motor—
</p>
<p>
And now, the illuminated threshold, Powder, the footmen, the inevitable
stack of letters—and Pauline.
</p>
<p>
But outside the spring dusk was secretly weaving its velvet spell. He
said to himself: "Shouldn't wonder if I slept ten hours at a stretch
tonight."

THE door of his private office clicked on a withdrawing client, and
Dexter Manford, giving his vigorous shoulders a shake, rose from his
desk and stood irresolute.
</p>
<p>
"I must get out to Cedarledge for some golf on Saturday," he thought. He
lived among people who regarded golf as a universal panacea, and in a
world which believed in panaceas.
</p>
<p>
As he stood there, his glance lit on the looking-glass above the mantel
and he mustered his image impatiently. Queer thing, for a man of his age
to gape at himself in a looking-glass like a dago dancing-master! He saw
a swarthy straight-nosed face, dark crinkling hair with a dash of gray
on the temples, dark eyes under brows that were beginning to beetle
across a deep vertical cleft. Complexion turning from ruddy to sallow;
eyes heavy—would he put his tongue out next? The matter with him
was...
</p>
<p>
He dropped back into his desk-chair and unhooked the telephone receiver.
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. James Wyant? Yes... Oh—<i>out</i>? You're sure? And you don't
know when she'll be back? Who? Yes; Mr. Manford. I had a message for Mrs.
Wyant. No matter."
</p>
<p>
He hung up and leaned back, stretching his legs under the table and
staring moodily at the heap of letters and legal papers in the
morocco-lined baskets set out before him.
</p>
<p>
"I look ten years older than my age," he thought. Yet that last new
type-writer, Miss Vollard, or whatever her name was, really behaved as
if ... was always looking at him when she thought he wasn't looking...
"Oh, what rot!" he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
His day had been as all his days were now: a starting in with a great
sense of pressure, importance and authority—and a drop at the close
into staleness and futility.
</p>
<p>
The evening before, he had stopped to see his doctor and been told that
he was over-working, and needed a nerve-tonic and a change of scene.
"Cruise to the West Indies, or something of the sort. Couldn't you get
away for three or four weeks? No? Well, more golf then, anyhow."
</p>
<p>
Getting away from things; the perpetual evasion, moral, mental,
physical, which he heard preached, and saw practised, everywhere about
him, except where money-making was concerned! He, Dexter Manford, who
had been brought up on a Minnesota farm, paid his own way through the
State College at Delos, and his subsequent course in the Harvard Law
School; and who, ever since, had been working at the top of his pitch
with no more sense of strain, no more desire for evasion (shirking, he
called it) than a healthy able-bodied man of fifty had a right to feel!
If his task had been mere money-getting he might have known—and
acknowledged—weariness. But he gloried in his profession, in its
labours and difficulties as well as its rewards, it satisfied him
intellectually and gave him that calm sense of mastery—mastery over
himself and others—known only to those who are doing what they were
born to do.
</p>
<p>
Of course, at every stage of his career—and never more than now,
on its slippery pinnacle—he had suffered the thousand irritations
inseparable from a hard-working life: the trifles which waste one's
time, the fools who consume one's patience, the tricky failure of the
best-laid plans, the endless labour of rolling human stupidity up the
steep hill of understanding. But until lately these things had been a
stimulus: it had amused him to shake off trifles, baffle bores,
circumvent failure, and exercise his mental muscles in persuading stupid
people to do intelligent things. There was pioneer blood in him: he was
used to starting out every morning to hack his way through a fresh
growth of prejudices and obstacles; and though he liked his big
retaining fees he liked arguing a case even better.
</p>
<p>
Professionally, he was used to intellectual loneliness, and no longer
minded it. Outside of his profession he had a brain above the average,
but a general education hardly up to it; and the discrepancy between
what he would have been capable of enjoying had his mind been prepared
for it, and what it could actually take in, made him modest and almost
shy in what he considered cultivated society. He had long believed his
wife to be cultivated because she had fits of book-buying and there was
an expensively bound library in the New York house. In his raw youth, in
the old Delos days, he had got together a little library of his own in
which Robert Ingersoll's lectures represented science, the sermons of
the Reverend Frank Gunsaulus of Chicago, theology, John Burroughs,
natural history, and Jared Sparks and Bancroft almost the whole of
history. He had gradually discovered the inadequacy of these guides, but
without ever having done much to replace them. Now and then, when he was
not too tired, and had the rare chance of a quiet evening, he picked up
a book from Pauline's table; but the works she acquired were so
heterogeneous, and of such unequal value, that he rarely found one worth
reading. Mrs. Tallentyre's "Voltaire" had been a revelation: he
discovered, to his surprise, that he had never really known who Voltaire
was, or what sort of a world he had lived in, and why his name had
survived it. After that, Manford decided to start in on a course of
European history, and got as far as taking the first volume of Macaulay
up to bed. But he was tired at night, and found Macaulay's periods too
long (though their eloquence appealed to his forensic instinct): and
there had never been time for that course of history.
</p>
<p>
In his early wedded days, before he knew much of his wife's world, he
had dreamed of quiet evenings at home, when Pauline would read
instructive books aloud while he sat by the fire and turned over his
briefs in some quiet inner chamber of his mind. But Pauline had never
known any one who wanted to be read aloud to except children getting
over infantile complaints. She regarded the desire almost as a symptom
of illness, and decided that Dexter needed "rousing," and that she must
do more to amuse him. As soon as she was able after Nona's birth she
girt herself up for this new duty; and from that day Manford's life, out
of office hours, had been one of almost incessant social activity. At
first the endless going out had bewildered, then for a while amused and
flattered him, then gradually grown to be a soothing routine, a sort of
mild drug-taking after the high pressure of professional hours; but of
late it had become simply a bore, a duty to be persisted in
because—as he had at last discovered—Pauline could not live
without it. After twenty years of marriage he was only just beginning to
exercise his intellectual acumen on his wife.
</p>
<p>
The thought of Pauline made him glance at his clock: she would be coming
in a moment. He unhooked the receiver again, and named, impatiently, the
same number as before. "Out, you say? Still?" (The same stupid voice
making the same stupid answer!) "Oh, no; no matter. I say <i>it's no
matter</i>," he almost shouted, replacing the receiver. Of all idiotic
servants—!
</p>
<p>
Miss Vollard, the susceptible type-writer, shot a shingled head around
the door, said "<i>All</i> right" with an envious sigh to some one outside,
and effaced herself before the brisk entrance of her employer's wife.
Manford got to his feet.
</p>
<p>
"Well, my dear—" He pushed an armchair near the fire, solicitous,
still a little awed by her presence—the beautiful Mrs. Wyant who
had deigned to marry him. Pauline, throwing back her furs, cast a quick
house-keeping glance about her. The scent she used always reminded him
of a superior disinfectant; and in another moment, he knew, she would
find some pretext for assuring herself, by the application of a gloved
finger-tip, that there was no dust on desk or mantelpiece. She had very
nearly obliged him, when he moved into his new office, to have concave
surbases, as in a hospital ward or a hygienic nursery. She had adopted
with enthusiasm the idea of the concave tiling fitted to every cove and
angle, so that there were no corners anywhere to catch the dust.
People's lives ought to be like that: with no corners in them. She
wanted to de-microbe life.
</p>
<p>
But, in the case of his own office, Manford had resisted; and now, he
understood, the fad had gone to the scrap-heap—with how many others!
</p>
<p>
"Not too near the fire." Pauline pushed her armchair back and glanced up
to see if the ceiling ventilators were working. "You <i>do</i> renew the
air at regular intervals? I'm sure everything depends on that; that and
thought-direction. What the Mahatma calls mental deep-breathing." She
smiled persuasively. "You look tired, Dexter ... tired and drawn."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, rot!—A cigarette?"
</p>
<p>
She shook her small resolute head. "You forget that he's cured me of
that too—the Mahatma. Dexter," she exclaimed suddenly, "I'm sure it's
this silly business of the Grant Lindons' that's worrying you. I want to
talk to you about it—to clear it up with you. It's out of the
question that you should be mixed up in it."
</p>
<p>
Manford had gone back to his desk-chair. Habit made him feel more at
home there, in fuller possession of himself; Pauline, in the seat facing
him, the light full on her, seemed no more than a client to be advised,
or an opponent to be talked over. He knew she felt the difference too.
So far he had managed to preserve his professional privacy and his
professional authority. What he did "at the office" was clouded over,
for his family, by the vague word "business," which meant that a man
didn't want to be bothered. Pauline had never really distinguished
between practising the law and manufacturing motors; nor had Manford
encouraged her to. But today he suspected that she meant her
interference to go to the extreme limit which her well-known "tact"
would permit.
</p>
<p>
"You must not be mixed up in this investigation. Why not hand it over to
somebody else? Alfred Cosby, or that new Jew who's so clever? The
Lindons would accept any one you recommended; unless, of course," she
continued, "you could persuade them to drop it, which would be so much
better. I'm sure you could, Dexter; you always know what to say—and
your opinion carries such weight. Besides, what is it they complain of?
Some nonsense of Bee's, I've no doubt—she took a rest-cure at the
School. If they'd brought the girl up properly there'd have been no
trouble. Look at Nona!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh—Nona!" Manford gave a laugh of pride. Nona was the one warm rich
spot in his life: the corner on which the sun always shone. Fancy
comparing that degenerate fool of a Bee Lindon to his Nona, and
imagining that "bringing-up" made the difference! Still, he had to admit
that Pauline—always admirable—had been especially so as a
mother. Yet she too was bitten with this theosophical virus!
</p>
<p>
He lounged back, hands in pockets, one leg swinging, instinctively
seeking an easier attitude as his moral ease diminished.
</p>
<p>
"My dear, it's always been understood, hasn't it, that what goes on in
this office is between me and my clients, and not—"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, nonsense, Dexter!" She seldom took that tone: he saw that she was
losing her self-control. "Look here: I make it a rule never to
interfere; you've just said so. Well—if I interfere now, it's because
I've a right to—because it's a duty! The Lindons are my son's
cousins: Fanny Lindon was a Wyant. Isn't that reason enough?"
</p>
<p>
"It was one of the Lindons' reasons. They appealed to me on that very
ground."
</p>
<p>
Pauline gave an irritated laugh. "How like Fanny! Always pushing in and
claiming things. I wonder such an argument took you in. Do consider,
Dexter! I won't for a minute admit that there can be anything wrong
about the Mahatma; but supposing there were..." She drew herself up,
her lips tightening. "I hope I know how to respect professional secrecy,
and I don't ask you to repeat their nasty insinuations; in fact, as you
know, I always take particular pains to avoid hearing anything painful
or offensive. But, supposing there were any ground for what they say; do
they realize how the publicity is going to affect Bee's reputation? And
how shall you feel if you set the police at work and find them
publishing the name of a girl who is Jim's cousin, and a friend of your
own daughter's?"
</p>
<p>
Manford moved restlessly in his chair, and in so doing caught his
reflexion in the mirror, and saw that his jaw had lost its stern
professional cast. He made an attempt to recover it, but unsuccessfully.
</p>
<p>
"But all this is too absurd," Pauline continued on a smoother note. "The
Mahatma and his friends have nothing to fear. Whose judgment would you
sooner trust: mine, or poor Fanny's? What really bothers me is your
allowing the Lindons to drag you into an affair which is going to
discredit them, and not the Mahatma." She smiled her bright frosty
smile. "You know how proud I am of your professional prestige: I should
hate to have you associated with a failure." She paused, and he saw that
she meant to rest on that.
</p>
<p>
"This is a pretty bad business. The Lindons have got their proofs all
right," he said.
</p>
<p>
Pauline reddened, and her face lost its look of undaunted serenity. "How
can you believe such rubbish, Dexter? If you're going to take Fanny
Lindon's word against mine—"
</p>
<p>
"It's not a question of your word or hers. Lindon is fully documented:
he didn't come to me till he was. I'm sorry, Pauline; but you've been
deceived. This man has got to be shown up, and the Lindons have had the
pluck to do what everybody else has shirked."
</p>
<p>
Pauline's angry colour had faded. She got up and stood before her
husband, distressed and uncertain; then, with a visible effort at
self-command, she seated herself again, and locked her hands about her
gold-mounted bag.
</p>
<p>
"Then you'd rather the scandal, if there is one, should be paraded
before the world? Who will gain by that except the newspaper reporters,
and the people who want to drag down society? And how shall you feel if
Nona is called as a witness—or Lita?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, nonsense—" He stopped abruptly, and got up too. The
discussion was lasting longer than he had intended, and he could not
find the word to end it. His mind felt suddenly empty—empty of
arguments and formulas. "I don't know why you persist in bringing in
Nona—or Lita—"
</p>
<p>
"I don't; it's you. You will, that is, if you take this case. Bee and
Nona have been intimate since they were babies, and Bee is always at
Lita's. Don't you suppose the Mahatma's lawyers will make use of that if
you <i>oblige</i> him to fight? You may say you're prepared for it; and I
admire your courage—but I can't share it. The idea that our children
may be involved simply sickens me."
</p>
<p>
"Neither Nona nor Lita has ever had anything to do with this charlatan
and his humbug, as far as I know," said Manford irritably.
</p>
<p>
"Nona has attended his eurythmic classes at our house, and gone to his
lectures with me: at one time they interested her intensely." Pauline
paused. "About Lita I don't know: I know so little about Lita's life
before her marriage."
</p>
<p>
"It was presumably that of any of Nona's other girl friends."
</p>
<p>
"Presumably. Kitty Landish might enlighten us. But of course, if it
<i>was</i>—" he noted her faintly sceptical emphasis—"I
don't admit that that would preclude Lita's having known the Mahatma, or
believed in him. And you must remember, Dexter, that I should be the
most deeply involved of all! I mean to take a rest-cure at Dawnside in
March." She gave the little playful laugh with which she had been used,
in old times, to ridicule the naughtiness of her children.
</p>
<p>
Manford drummed on his blotting-pad. "Look here, suppose we drop this
for the present—"
</p>
<p>
She glanced at her wrist-watch. "If you can spare the time—"
</p>
<p>
"Spare the time?"
</p>
<p>
She answered softly: "I'm not going away till you've promised."
</p>
<p>
Manford could remember the day when that tone—so feminine under
its firmness—would have had the power to shake him. Pauline, in
her wifely dealings, so seldom invoked the prerogative of her grace, her
competence, her persuasiveness, that when she did he had once found it
hard to resist. But that day was past. Under his admiration for her
brains, and his esteem for her character, he had felt, of late, a
stealing boredom. She was too clever, too efficient, too uniformly
sagacious and serene. Perhaps his own growing sense of
power—professional and social—had secretly undermined his
awe of hers, made him feel himself first her equal, then ever so little
her superior. He began to detect something obtuse in that unfaltering
competence. And as his professional authority grew he had become more
jealous of interference with it. His wife ought at least to have
understood that! If her famous tact were going to fail her, what would
be left, he asked himself?
</p>
<p>
"Look here, Pauline, you know all this is useless. In professional
matters no one else can judge for me. I'm busy this afternoon; I'm sure
you are too—"
</p>
<p>
She settled more deeply into her armchair. "Never too busy for you,
Dexter."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you, dear. But the time I ask you to give me is outside of
business hours," he rejoined with a slight smile.
</p>
<p>
"Then I'm dismissed?" She smiled back. "I understand; you needn't ring!"
She rose with recovered serenity and laid a light hand on his shoulder.
"Sorry to have bothered you; I don't often, do I? All I ask is that you
should think over—"
</p>
<p>
He lifted the hand to his lips. "Of course, of course." Now that she was
going he could say it.
</p>
<p>
"I'm forgiven?"
</p>
<p>
He smiled: "You're forgiven;" and from the threshold she called, almost
gaily: "Don't forget tonight—Amalasuntha!"
</p>
<p>
His brow clouded as he returned to his chair; and oddly enough—he was
aware of the oddness—it was clouded not by the tiresome scene he had
been through, but by his wife's reminder. "Damn that dinner," he swore
to himself.
</p>
<p>
He turned to the telephone, unhooked it for the third time, and called
for the same number.
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>
That evening, as he slipped the key into his front-door, Dexter Manford
felt the oppression of all that lay behind it. He never entered his house
without a slight consciousness of the importance of the act—never
completely took for granted the resounding vestibule, the big hall with
its marble staircase ascending to all the light and warmth and luxury
which skill could devise, money buy, and Pauline's ingenuity combine in
a harmonious whole. He had not yet forgotten the day when, after one of
his first legal successes, he had installed a bathroom in his mother's
house at Delos, and all the neighbours had driven in from miles around
to see it.
</p>
<p>
But luxury, and above all comfort, had never weighed on him; he was too
busy to think much about them, and sure enough of himself and his powers
to accept them as his right. It was not the splendour of his house that
oppressed him but the sense of the corporative bonds it imposed. It
seemed part of an elaborate social and domestic structure, put together
with the baffling ingenuity of certain bird's-nests of which he had seen
the pictures. His own career, Pauline's multiple activities, the problem
of poor Arthur Wyant, Nona, Jim, Lita Wyant, the Mahatma, the tiresome
Grant Lindons, the perennial and inevitable Amalasuntha, for whom the
house was being illuminated tonight—all were strands woven into the
very pile of the carpet he trod on his way up the stairs. As he passed
the dining-room he saw, through half-open doors, the glitter of glass
and silver, a shirt-sleeved man placing bowls of roses down the long
table, and Maisie Bruss, wan but undaunted, dealing out dinner cards to
Powder, the English butler.

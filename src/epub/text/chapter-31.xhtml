			<p class="drop-cap">NONA MANFORD’S room was full of spring flowers. They had poured in, sent by sympathizing friends, ever since she had been brought back to town from Cedarledge.</p>
			<p>That was two weeks ago. It was full spring now, and her windows stood wide to the May sunset slanting across the room, and giving back to the tall branches of blossoming plum and cherry something of their native scent and freshness.</p>
			<p>The reminder of Cedarledge would once have doubled their beauty; now it made her shut her eyes sharply, in the inner recoil from all the name brought back.</p>
			<p>She was still confined to her room, for the shot which had fractured her arm near the shoulder had also grazed her lung, and her temperature remained obstinately high. Shock, the doctors said, chiefly⁠ ⁠… the appalling sight of a masked burglar in her sister-in-law’s bedroom; and being twice fired at⁠—twice!</p>
			<p>Lita corroborated the story. She had been asleep when her door was softly opened, and she had started up to see a man in a mask, with a dark lantern⁠ ⁠… Yes; she was almost sure he had a mask; at any rate she couldn’t see his face; the police had found the track of muddy feet on the pantry linoleum, and up the back stairs.</p>
			<p>Lita had screamed, and Nona had dashed to the rescue; yes, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Manford⁠—Lita thought <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Manford had perhaps got there before Nona. But then again, she wasn’t sure⁠ ⁠… The fact was that Lita had been shattered by the night’s experience, and her evidence, if not self-contradictory, was at least incoherent.</p>
			<p>The only really lucid witnesses were Powder, the butler, and Nona Manford herself. Their statements agreed exactly, or at least dovetailed into each other with perfect precision, the one completing the other. Nona had been first on the scene: she had seen the man in the room⁠—she too thought that he was masked⁠—and he had turned on her and fired. At that moment her father, hearing the shots, had rushed in, half-dressed; and as he did so the burglar fled. Some one professed to have seen him running away through the rain and darkness; but no one had seen his face, and there was no way of identifying him. The only positive proof of his presence⁠—except for the shot⁠—was the discovery by Powder, of those carefully guarded footprints on the pantry floor; and these, of course, might eventually help to trace the criminal. As for the revolver, that also had disappeared; and the bullets, one of which had been found lodged in the door, the other in the panelling of the room, were of ordinary army calibre, and offered no clue. Altogether it was an interesting problem for the police, who were reported to be actively at work on it, though so far without visible results.</p>
			<p>Then, after three days of flaming headlines and journalistic conjectures, another sensation crowded out the Cedarledge burglary. The newspaper public, bored with the inability of the police to provide fresh fuel for their curiosity, ceased to speculate on the affair, and interest in it faded out as quickly as it had flared up.</p>
			<p>During the last few days Nona’s temperature had gradually dropped, and she had been allowed to see visitors; first one in the day, then two or three, then four or five⁠—so that by this time her jaws were beginning to feel a little stiff with the continual rehearsal of her story, embellished (at the visitors’ request) with an analysis of her own emotions. She always repeated her narrative in exactly the same terms, and presented the incidents in exactly the same order; by now she had even learned to pause at the precise point where she knew her sympathizing auditors would say: “But, my dear, how perfectly awful⁠—what did it feel like?”</p>
			<p>“Like being shot in the arm.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, Nona, you’re so cynical! But before that⁠—when you <i>saw the man</i>⁠—weren’t you absolutely sick with terror?”</p>
			<p>“He didn’t give me time to be sick with anything but the pain in my shoulder.”</p>
			<p>“You’ll never get her to confess that she was frightened!”</p>
			<p>And so the dialogue went on. Did her listeners notice that she recited her tale with the unvarying precision of a lesson learned by heart? Probably not; if they did, they made no sign. The papers had all been full of the burglary at Cedarledge: a masked burglar⁠—and of the shooting of Miss Manford, and the would-be murderer’s escape. The account, blood-curdling and definite, had imposed itself on the public credulity with all the authority of heavy headlines and continual repetition. Within twenty-four hours the Cedarledge burglary was an established fact, and suburban millionaires were doubling the number of their night watchmen, and looking into the newest thing in burglar-alarms. Nona, leaning back wearily on her couch, wondered how soon she would be allowed to travel and get away from it all.</p>
			<p>The others were all going to travel. Her mother and father were off that very evening to the Rocky Mountains and Vancouver. From there they were going to Japan and, in the early autumn, to Ceylon and India. Pauline already had letters to all the foremost Native Princes, and was regretting that there was not likely to be a Durbar during their visit. The Manfords did not expect to be back till January or February; Manford’s professional labours had become so exhausting that the doctors, fearing his accumulated fatigue might lead to a nervous break-down, had ordered a complete change and prolonged absence from affairs. Pauline hoped that Nona would meet them in Egypt on their way home. A sunny Christmas together in Cairo would be so lovely⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Arthur Wyant had gone also⁠—to Canada, it was said, with cousin Eleanor in attendance. Some insinuated that a private inebriate asylum in Maine was the goal of his journey; but no one really knew, and few cared. His remaining cronies, when they heard that he had been ill, and was to travel for a change, shrugged or smiled, and said: “Poor old Arthur⁠—been going it too strong again,” and then forgot about him. He had long since lost his place in the scheme of things.</p>
			<p>Even Lita and Jim Wyant were on a journey. They had sailed the previous week for Paris, where they would arrive in time for the late spring season, and Lita would see the Grand Prix, the new fashions and the new plays. Jim’s holiday had been extended to the end of August: Manford, ever solicitous for his stepson, had arranged the matter with the bank. It was natural, every one agreed, that Jim should have been dreadfully upset by the ghastly episode at Cedarledge, in which his wife might have been a victim as well as Nona; and his intimates knew how much he had worried about his father’s growing intemperance. Altogether, both Wyants and Manfords had been subjected to an unusual strain; and when rich people’s nerves are out of gear the pleasant remedy of travel is the first prescribed.</p>
			<p>
				<br/>
			</p>
			<p>Nona turned her head uneasily on the cushions. She felt incurably weary, and unable to rebound to the spring radiance which usually set her blood in motion. Her immobility had begun to wear on her. At first it had been a relief to be quiescent, to be out of things, to be offered up as the passive victim and the accepted evidence of the Cedarledge burglary. But now she was sick to nausea of the part, and envious of the others who could escape by flight⁠—by perpetual evasion.</p>
			<p>Not that she really wanted to be one of them; she was not sure that she wanted to go away at all⁠—at least in the body. Spiritual escape was what she craved; but by what means, and whither? Perhaps it could best be attained by staying just where she was, by sticking fast to her few square feet of obligations and responsibilities. But even this idea made no special appeal. Her obligations, her responsibilities⁠—what were they? Negative, at best, like everything else in her life. She had thought that renunciation would mean freedom⁠—would mean at least escape. But today it seemed to mean only a closer self-imprisonment. She was tired, no doubt⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>There was a tap on the door, and her mother entered. Nona raised her listless eyes curiously. She always looked at her mother with curiosity now: curiosity not so much as to what had changed in her, but as to what had remained the same. And it was extraordinary how Pauline, the old Pauline, was coming to the surface again through the new one, the haggard and stricken apparition of the Cedarledge midnight⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>“My broken arm saved her,” Nona thought, remembering, with a sort of ironical admiration, how that dishevelled spectre had become Pauline Manford again, in command of herself and the situation, as soon as she could seize on its immediate, its practical, sides; could grasp those handles of reality to which she always clung.</p>
			<p>Now even that stern and disciplined figure had vanished, giving way, as the days passed and reassurance grew, to the usual, the everyday Pauline, smilingly confident in herself and in the general security of things. Had that dreadful night at Cedarledge ever been a reality to her? If it had, Nona was sure, it had already faded into the realms of fable, since its one visible result had been her daughter’s injury, and that was on the way to healing. Everything else connected with it had happened out of sight and under ground, and for that reason was now as if it had never existed for Pauline, who was more than ever resolutely two-dimensional.</p>
			<p>Physically, at least, the only difference Nona could detect was that a skilful make-up had filled in the lines which, in spite of all the arts of the face-restorers, were weaving their permanent web about her mother’s lips and eyes. Under this delicate mask Pauline’s face looked younger and fresher than ever, and as smooth and empty as if she had just been born again⁠—“And she <i>has</i>, after all,” Nona concluded.</p>
			<p>She sat down by the couch, and laid a light hand caressingly on her daughter’s.</p>
			<p>“Darling! Had your tea? You feel really better, don’t you? The doctor says the massage is to begin tomorrow. By the way⁠—” she tossed a handful of newspaper cuttings onto the coverlet⁠—“perhaps some of these things about the reception may amuse you. Maisie’s been saving them to show you. Of course most of the foreign names are wrong; but the description of the room is rather good. I believe Tommy Ardwin wrote the article for the ‘Looker-on.’ Amalasuntha says the Cardinal will like it. It seems he was delighted with the idea of the flash-light photographs. Altogether he was very much pleased.”</p>
			<p>“Then you ought to be, mother.” Nona forced her pale lips into a smile.</p>
			<p>“I <i>am</i>, dear. If I do a thing at all I like to do it well. That’s always been my theory, you know: the best or nothing. And I do believe it was a success. But perhaps I’m tiring you⁠—.” Pauline stood up irresolutely. She had never been good at bedsides unless she could play some active and masterful part there. Nona was aware that her mother’s moments alone with her had become increasingly difficult as her strength had returned, and there was nothing more to be done for her. It was as well that the Manfords were starting on their journey that evening.</p>
			<p>“Don’t stay, mother; I’m all right, really. It’s only that things still tire me a little⁠—”</p>
			<p>Pauline lingered, looking down on the girl with an expression of anxiety struggling through her smooth rejuvenation.</p>
			<p>“I wish I felt happier about leaving you, darling. I know you’re all right, of course; but the idea of your staying in this house all by yourself⁠—”</p>
			<p>“It’s just what I shall like. And on father’s account you ought to get away.”</p>
			<p>“It’s what I feel,” Pauline assented, brightening.</p>
			<p>“You must be awfully busy with all the last things to be done. I’m as comfortable as possible; I wish you’d just go off and forget about me.”</p>
			<p>“Well, Maisie is clamouring for me,” Pauline confessed from the threshold.</p>
			<p>The door shut, and Nona closed her eyes with a sigh. Tomorrow⁠—tomorrow she would be alone! And in a week, perhaps, she would get back to Cedarledge, and lie on the terrace with the dogs about her, and no one to ask questions, to hint and sympathize, or be discreet and evasive⁠ ⁠… Yes, in spite of everything, the idea of returning to Cedarledge now seemed more bearable than any other⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>In a restless attempt to ease her position she stretched her hand out, and it came in contact with the bundle of newspaper cuttings. She shrank back with a little grimace; then she smiled. After the night at Cedarledge every one had supposed⁠—even Maisie and Powder had⁠—that the Cardinal’s reception would have to be given up, since, owing to his Eminence’s impending departure, it could not be deferred. But it had come off on the appointed day⁠—only the fourth after the burglary⁠—and Pauline had made it a success. The girl really admired her mother for that. Something in her own composition responded to the energy with which the older woman could meet an emergency when there was no way of turning it. The party had been not only brilliant but entertaining. Every one had been there, all the official and ecclesiastical dignitaries, including the Bishop of New York and the Chief Rabbi⁠—yes, even the Scientific Initiate, looking colossal and Siberian in some half-priestly dress that added its note to the general picturesqueness; and yet there had been no crush, no confusion, nothing to detract from the dignity and amenity of the evening. Nona suspected her mother of longing to invite the Mahatma, whose Oriental garb would have been so effective, and who would have been so flattered, poor man! But she had not risked it, and her chief lion, after the great ecclesiastics, had turned out to be Michelangelo, the newly arrived, with the film-glamour enhancing his noble Roman beauty, and his mother at his side, explaining and parading him.</p>
			<p>“The pity is that dear Jim and Lita have sailed,” the Marchesa declared to all who would give ear. “That’s really a great disappointment. I did hope Lita would have been here tonight. She and my Michelangelo would have made such a glorious couple: the Old World and the New. Or as Antony and Cleopatra⁠—only fancy! My boy tells me that Klawhammer is looking for a Cleopatra. But dear Lita will be back before long⁠—.” And she mingled her hopes and regrets with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Percy Landish’s.</p>
